# The frontend and backend are managed in a monorepo structure with centralized config (`config/` and `.env`).

# (Optional) Start Dash analytics dashboard
python GoldenSignalsAI/presentation/frontend/app/dashboard.py
```

---

## Admin Panel Usage

- Access the admin panel from the main dashboard UI (localhost:8080)
- Log in with Firebase (email/password, Google, GitHub)
- Admins can:
  - Monitor performance, agent health, queue
  - Manage users and roles
  - Restart/disable agents
  - Invite, reset password, or delete users
- All actions are audit-logged to `./logs/admin_audit.log`
- Alerts are shown for system or agent issues

---

## Security Best Practices
- Never commit real API keys or secrets
- Use `.env` for all secrets, reference with `os.getenv`
- Restrict admin access via Firebase custom claims
- All admin endpoints require valid Firebase ID token
- Regularly review `admin_audit.log` for compliance

---

## Extending & Customizing
- **Add new agents:** Create a new Python agent class and register in the backend
- **Add new admin features:** Add endpoints in FastAPI, then UI in React
- **Integrate new auth providers:** Enable in Firebase console and update frontend
- **Customize onboarding:** Edit `AdminOnboardingModal.js`

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Auth errors:** Check Firebase config and service account
- **API errors:** Check `.env` for missing/expired keys
- **Frontend/backend not connecting:** Confirm CORS and port settings
- **Audit log missing:** Ensure `logs/` directory exists and is writable
- **Ticker validation errors:** If you see 'Invalid ticker symbol', ensure the backend is running and the symbol exists in supported data sources.

## Robustness, Validation, and Error Handling (Advanced Agents)

All advanced agent endpoints implement:

- **Pydantic request/response models**: Strict input validation for all endpoints.
- **Structured error responses**: All errors are returned as JSON with an `error` field.
- **Logging**: All requests and errors are logged for debugging and monitoring.
- **Edge case handling**: Endpoints handle empty/invalid input and return clear error messages.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "average_score": 0.0,
  "raw_results": [{"error": "No texts provided."}]
}
```

### Example Log Output

```
INFO:root:FinBERT /analyze called with 0 texts.
ERROR:root:FinBERT error: No texts provided.
```

### Negative Test Coverage

A dedicated test suite (`tests/test_api_endpoints_negative.py`) ensures endpoints handle invalid input gracefully and never crash. It covers scenarios such as:
- Empty input lists
- Insufficient data for time series models
- Invalid or missing required fields
- Model not trained/loaded

Run all tests (including negative cases):
```bash
pytest tests/
```

For more details, see the `tests/` directory and API endpoint docstrings.
