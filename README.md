## üöÄ Project Goal
GoldenSignalsAI is an AI-powered stock prediction and trade suggestion platform. It predicts whether a stock will go **up or down** in a given timeframe and suggests actionable entry and exit points for **calls or puts**. The platform leverages advanced machine learning, real-time and historical market data from multiple sources (including Financial Modeling Prep, Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Finnhub, and more), and a modern dashboard UI to empower traders with intelligent, actionable insights.

---

## Features

- üìà **Stock Direction Prediction**: Predicts up/down movement for any supported stock and timeframe using AI/ML models.
- üéØ **Trade Suggestions**: Recommends entry and exit points for calls or puts based on predictions and market context.
- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent, Multi-Source Data**: Integrates data from Financial Modeling Prep, Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Finnhub, and more for robust, reliable signals.
- üìä **Performance & Signal Dashboard**: Modern, responsive dashboard for viewing predictions, trade suggestions, and performance metrics.
- üîí **Secure Admin API Layer**: All admin API requests use a JWT/session token, injected via a robust `authFetch` wrapper. 401 responses trigger auto-redirect to `/login`.
- üìà **Export to CSV/JSON**: Download any table (signals, agent stats, audit log) as Excel-ready CSV or JSON for audits, ML, or archiving.
- ü§ñ **Agent Health Monitor**: Live dashboard for agent online/offline status, uptime, ping, and error count. Auto-refreshes every 30s.
- üìÖ **Scheduled Reports System**: Schedule daily/weekly reports (signals, agent stats, audit log) as CSV/JSON. Fully managed via the admin UI, with all actions audit-logged.
- üìù **Audit Logging**: All critical admin actions (agent control, report scheduling, etc.) are tracked in a live audit log, visible in the dashboard and exportable.
- ‚ö° **Dynamic Ticker Search & Autocomplete**: Instantly search and select tickers with live validation and autocomplete.
- üîî **Visual Alerts & Monitoring**: Alerts for prediction confidence, model health, and system status.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Role-Based Admin Panel**: User management, access control, and audit logging.
- üîí **Secure, Extensible Architecture**: Modular backend and frontend, with best practices for secrets and user authentication.

---

## Frontend Architecture & Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and robust accessibility.
- **Global Shell**: Planned persistent sidebar, header, and dynamic content area for all pages.
- **Pages:**
  - Dashboard: Real-time signals, equity curve, summary KPIs, alerts, heatmap, recent activity.
  - Signals: Interactive price chart with buy/sell/hold markers, signal history, confidence bars.
  - Watchlist: Ticker cards, sparklines, P/L, drag-and-drop reorder.
  - Backtest: Equity curve, drawdown, performance metrics, correlation matrix.
  - Agents: Toggle agent list, configuration panel.
  - Settings: API keys, notification preferences, profile.
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Real-time WebSocket feeds for ticks and signals.
  - Interactive chart overlays, drawing tools, multi-timeframe toggles.
  - Guided tour, quick-action toolbar, session replay, notifications.
  - Unified error handling: UI never crashes on missing env or API errors‚Äîshows warnings instead.
- **Environment Sync:**
  - Use `scripts/sync-env.sh` to keep frontend and backend envs in sync.
  - All frontend env vars must start with `VITE_`.

---

## Admin Dashboard: Power Features

### Secure API Layer
- All admin API calls use `authFetch`, which injects the JWT/session token from localStorage and auto-redirects to `/login` on 401.
- **Usage:** On login, store your token via `localStorage.setItem("token", "<your_token>")`.

### Export to CSV/JSON
- Download any table (signals, agent stats, audit log) as CSV or JSON with one click.
- **Usage:** Click the Export CSV/JSON buttons above each table in the admin dashboard.

### Agent Health Monitor
- View all agent statuses (online/offline), uptime, ping, and error count in real time.
- **Usage:** See the "Agent Health Monitor" panel in the admin dashboard. Data auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

### Scheduled Reports System
- Schedule daily or weekly exports of signals, agent stats, or audit logs in CSV or JSON format.
- **Usage:** Use the "Schedule Automated Reports" panel in the admin dashboard. All scheduling actions are tracked in the audit log.

### Audit Logging
- All admin actions (agent control, report scheduling, etc.) are tracked and visible in the live audit log panel.
- **Usage:** See the "Admin Audit Log" section. Export logs for compliance or review.

---
- **Conda Environment:**
  - Preferred environment: `goldensignalsai` (see memory notes).

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone & Install

#### Using Poetry (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaacbuz/GoldenSignalsAI.git
cd GoldenSignalsAI
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### 2. Environment Setup (Unified)
- Use a single `.env` file at the project root for all secrets, API keys, and environment variables.
- All frontend variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` (e.g. `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_FMP_API_KEY`).
- Backend variables are unprefixed and used by FastAPI and agents.
- To sync frontend variables, run:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/sync-env.sh
  ```
- This will update `presentation/frontend/.env` with only the `VITE_` variables from the root `.env`.
- **Never commit real secrets!** Use environment variables or vaults for production.
- Create and activate the conda environment (recommended):
  ```bash
  conda create -n goldensignalsai python=3.10
  conda activate goldensignalsai
  pip install poetry
  poetry install
  ```

### 3. Logging Configuration
- Logging is now centralized in `logging.yaml` for both console and file output. You can adjust log levels, formats, and destinations there.

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks
- Install pre-commit hooks to enforce code style and quality:
  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```
- This will run Black, isort, and flake8 on every commit.

### 5. Docker & Infra Structure
- All Dockerfiles are now grouped under `/docker`.
- Infra scripts and deploy scripts are grouped under `/scripts`.
- Update your `docker-compose.yml` and CI/CD scripts to reference these new paths.

### 6. Run the Platform
```bash
# Start FastAPI backend (in the goldensignalsai conda env)
poetry run python main.py

# Sync frontend .env (in project root)
bash scripts/sync-env.sh

# Start React frontend (from presentation/frontend)
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üß† How It Works

1. Agents (e.g., TV, ML, NLP) are registered and executed by the `AgentManager`.
2. Each agent returns a `signal = {"symbol", "action", "confidence", "agent"}`.
3. AgentManager aggregates signals and votes on consensus.
4. Signals are pushed to frontend via WebSocket and saved in PostgreSQL.
5. Sentiment from multiple platforms influences signal confidence.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Run frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Run agents manually:
```bash
python backend/agents/signal_engine.py --symbol AAPL
```

## Admin Panel Usage

- Access the admin panel from the main dashboard UI (localhost:8080)
- Log in with Firebase (email/password, Google, GitHub)
- Admins can:
  - Monitor performance, agent health, queue
  - Manage users and roles
  - Restart/disable agents
  - Invite, reset password, or delete users
- All actions are audit-logged to `./logs/admin_audit.log`
- Alerts are shown for system or agent issues

---

## Security Best Practices
- Never commit real API keys or secrets
- Use `.env` for all secrets, reference with `os.getenv`
- Restrict admin access via Firebase custom claims
- All admin endpoints require valid Firebase ID token
- Regularly review `admin_audit.log` for compliance

---

## Extending & Customizing
- **Add new agents:** Create a new Python agent class and register in the backend
- **Add new admin features:** Add endpoints in FastAPI, then UI in React
- **Integrate new auth providers:** Enable in Firebase console and update frontend
- **Customize onboarding:** Edit `AdminOnboardingModal.js`

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Auth errors:** Check Firebase config and service account
- **API errors:** Check `.env` for missing/expired keys
- **Frontend/backend not connecting:** Confirm CORS and port settings
- **Audit log missing:** Ensure `logs/` directory exists and is writable
- **Ticker validation errors:** If you see 'Invalid ticker symbol', ensure the backend is running and the symbol exists in supported data sources.

---

## Robustness, Validation, and Error Handling (Advanced Agents)

All advanced agent endpoints implement:

- **Pydantic request/response models**: Strict input validation for all endpoints.
- **Structured error responses**: All errors are returned as JSON with an `error` field.
- **Logging**: All requests and errors are logged for debugging and monitoring.
- **Edge case handling**: Endpoints handle empty/invalid input and return clear error messages.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "average_score": 0.0,
  "raw_results": [{"error": "No texts provided."}]
}
```

### Example Log Output

```
INFO:root:FinBERT /analyze called with 0 texts.
ERROR:root:FinBERT error: No texts provided.
```

### Negative Test Coverage

A dedicated test suite (`tests/test_api_endpoints_negative.py`) ensures endpoints handle invalid input gracefully and never crash. It covers scenarios such as:
- Empty input lists
- Insufficient data for time series models
- Invalid or missing required fields
- Model not trained/loaded

Run all tests (including negative cases):
```bash
pytest tests/
```

For more details, see the `tests/` directory and API endpoint docstrings.
