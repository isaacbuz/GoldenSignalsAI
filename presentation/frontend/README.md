# Running the Vite + React Frontend

To run the Vite + React frontend, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and make the application available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuring the Backend API URL

To configure the backend API URL, create a new file named `.env` in the project root directory and add the following line:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
```

Replace `https://your-backend-api-url.com` with the actual URL of your backend API.

Note: Make sure to restart the development server after making changes to the `.env` file.
